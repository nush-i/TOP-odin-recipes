# odin-recipes
This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using HTML. Throughout this project, I will demonstrate my understanding of:

- HTML structure and elements
- Creating and linking multiple web pages
- Embedding images and links

By the end of this project, I will have a simple but functional website that showcases different recipes.
